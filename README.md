## Project Description 📜

The **Movie Application** is a dynamic web-based app developed to practice and apply JavaScript skills learned during the course. Users can add their favorite movies, manage them by editing or deleting, and build a personalized list of favorite titles. The application includes a fully interactive interface using modals, dynamic rendering, and routing.

### Key Features:

- Add a new movie by entering details like **title**, **director**, **release year**, **summary**, **category**, and **rating** in a modal form.
- View all added movies on the **Home** page with movie cards generated dynamically.
- **Edit or delete** movies by interacting with each movie card. Clicking **Edit** opens a pre-filled modal where changes can be made and saved.
- Mark movies as **favorites** by clicking a favorite icon, then view all marked titles on a separate **Favorites** page accessible via the navigation bar.
- Use the **search bar** on the Home page to filter movies by title.

All features aim to simulate a real-world movie management system while focusing on object handling, event delegation, and DOM manipulation with JavaScript.

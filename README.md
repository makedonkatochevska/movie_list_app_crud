## Project Description 📜

The **Age Calculator** is a simple web application built using JavaScript, designed to calculate a user’s exact age based on their birthdate input. The goal is to reinforce concepts such as **JavaScript classes**, **date manipulation**, and **DOM interaction**.

### Key Features:

- Users can input their **birthdate** through an input field.
- The application calculates the user’s **age in years, months, OR weeks**.
- It uses a custom `AgeCalculator` class to handle logic and calculations.
- The calculated age is displayed dynamically on the page.

## Usage 🚀

### How to Use the Age Calculator

1. **Enter Your Birthdate**

   - Use the date picker input field to select your birthdate.

2. **Click the "Calculate" Button**

   - Triggers the age calculation function using a custom JavaScript class.

3. **View the Result**
   - Your exact age will be displayed in:
     - **Years**
     - **Months**
     - **Weeks**

### Under the Hood 🧠

- The `AgeCalculator` class is initialized with the selected birthdate.
- The `calculateAge()` method computes the difference between the birthdate and the current date.
- The `displayAge()` function outputs the calculated age to the UI dynamically.

## Credits 📝

This project was developed as part of a JavaScript challenge to practice:

- Working with JavaScript **classes** and **date manipulation**
- Creating dynamic **user interfaces**
- Applying real-world **calculations** based on user input
- DOM interaction and **event handling**
